### Muse 2016

It's fairly simple to get data streams out of the Muse 2016 (see muse_stream.py), but we don't have a good emotion dataset using the Muse (the two Kaggle ones don't have raw data).

Possible datasets, if we can find the raw data:
- https://www.kaggle.com/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-feeling-emotions
- https://www.kaggle.com/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-mental-state

Requirements:
- BlueMuse [link](https://github.com/kowalej/BlueMuse)
- muse-lsl [link](https://github.com/alexandrebarachant/muse-lsl)
